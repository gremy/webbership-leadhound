# Deploying leadhound to a server

leadhound runs on one Linux server with systemd, from timers.
Nothing in this directory names a server: the host is an ssh destination in your own ssh config, passed as `HOST=` on the command line, and every secret lives in files on the server.

## What runs when

All times are Europe/Bucharest.
Each timer adds a random delay of up to 10 minutes and is persistent, so a run missed while the server was down happens at the next boot.

| Timer | When | Runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `leadhound-ats.timer` | 01:00 | `collect ats`, then `score` |
| `leadhound-backup.timer` | 03:30 | `pg_dump -Fc` into `/var/backups/leadhound/`, newest 14 kept |
| `leadhound-collect.timer` | 06:30 and 14:30 | `collect linkedin`, then `score` |
| `leadhound-prebrief.timer` | 07:30 | `canary linkedin` (once a day; a second start the same day does nothing) |
| `leadhound-brief.timer` | 07:50 | `brief --send`, retried twice, 10 minutes apart, if the send fails |

Every command exits 0 once it has recorded its outcome, a stop such as `throttled`, `budget`, `parser_broke` or `spend_cap` included, because the brief reports it.
A non-zero exit means a crash or bad configuration.
In a unit with several steps every step but the last is written `ExecStart=-…`, so a crash in one never stops the next.
The two `score` steps take a lock in the data directory, so a long night run and the morning one never score side by side.

Every step that reaches LinkedIn (`collect linkedin`, `canary linkedin` and `brief --send`, whose recheck does) holds one shared lock, `/opt/leadhound/data/.linkedin.lock`, through `flock --wait <N> --conflict-exit-code 75`:

| Step | Waits up to | When the wait runs out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `collect linkedin` | 30 minutes | skipped (`ExecStart=-`), `score` still runs |
| `canary linkedin` | 45 minutes | the unit fails; the brief reports the canary as missing |
| `brief --send` | 30 minutes | exit 75, a failure, so `Restart=` retries it |

The lock timeout exits 75 rather than flock's default 1 so it is never confused with the program's own codes, and in particular never with 2, which `RestartPreventExitStatus=2` keeps for bad config.
The brief is ordered `After=` the collect and the canary, and the canary `After=` the collect, so a persistent catch-up after downtime runs them in that order.
`collect ats` runs under `timeout 5h` and `collect linkedin` under `timeout 2h`, so a hang never stops the `score` after it; each unit's `TimeoutStartSec` is longer than its lock waits and timeouts together.

The server is shared with other services, so every unit but the backup has `MemoryHigh=900M` and `MemoryMax=1200M`: past the ceiling the kernel stops leadhound, never a neighbour.
The two collect units also run at `CPUWeight=50`.

## Layout on the server

| Path | Owner, mode | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/opt/leadhound/bin/leadhound` | root, 0755 | the binary |
| `/opt/leadhound/bin/leadhound-backup` | root, 0755 | `deploy/leadhound-backup.sh` |
| `/opt/leadhound/data/` | leadhound, 0750 | `LEADHOUND_DATA_DIR`: `leadhound.yaml`, `ats-boards.yaml`, the outbox of a brief that is not sent |
| `/etc/leadhound/env` | root, 0600, enforced | the units' environment (`deploy/env.example`) |
| `/etc/leadhound/migrate.env` | root, 0600, enforced | the owner role's URL, for `migrate` only (`deploy/migrate.env.example`) |
| `/etc/systemd/system/leadhound-*` | root, 0644 | the units and timers |
| `/var/backups/leadhound/` | postgres, 0700 | the nightly dumps |

`deploy/install.sh` sets both env files to `root:root 0600` on every deploy, before anything reads them.

## One-time bootstrap

Run these on the server as root, in order.

1. Create the user and the directories:

   ```sh
   useradd --system --home-dir /opt/leadhound --shell /usr/sbin/nologin leadhound
   install -d -o root -g root -m 0755 /opt/leadhound /opt/leadhound/bin
   install -d -o leadhound -g leadhound -m 0750 /opt/leadhound/data
   install -d -o root -g root -m 0700 /etc/leadhound
   ```

2. Install Postgres if the server has none (for example `apt install postgresql`).
   The backup runs as the `postgres` user over the local socket, so Postgres must be on this server.

3. Create the roles and the database, as the Postgres superuser, from a copy of this repository's `deploy/sql/`:

   ```sh
   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d postgres -f deploy/sql/roles.sql
   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE leadhound OWNER leadhound_owner"
   sudo -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d leadhound -f deploy/sql/grants.sql
   ```

   Then give both roles a password generated on the server (`openssl rand -hex 32`), set with `ALTER ROLE … PASSWORD` in `psql`, never on a command line that lands in a shell history.

4. Write `/etc/leadhound/env` from `deploy/env.example` and `/etc/leadhound/migrate.env` from `deploy/migrate.env.example`, both `root:root 0600`.
   The env file sets `LEADHOUND_LIVE=1`.

5. From your machine, deploy (this checks, builds, copies, migrates and enables the timers):

   ```sh
   make deploy HOST=<ssh host> ARCH=arm64 CONFIRM=1   # or ARCH=amd64
   make deploy-data HOST=<ssh host> CONFIRM=1
   ```

   The ssh user needs `sudo` on the server.

6. Fill the board registry, which lives in the database, so the server's starts empty.
   Copy your board lists to a temporary directory on the server that the `leadhound` user can read, and import each one, for example:

   ```sh
   make remote HOST=<ssh host> CONFIRM=1 ARGS='boards import /tmp/boards/<list>.csv --origin <origin>'
   ```

   Delete the temporary copies afterwards.
   Boards in `ats-boards.yaml` are collected even when the registry does not hold them.

7. First manual runs, before the timers take over:

   ```sh
   make remote HOST=<ssh host> CONFIRM=1 ARGS='canary linkedin'
   make remote HOST=<ssh host> CONFIRM=1 ARGS='collect linkedin'
   make remote HOST=<ssh host> CONFIRM=1 ARGS='brief'
   ```

   `brief` without `--send` writes the brief to the outbox and sends nothing, but its recheck still reaches LinkedIn, so it needs `CONFIRM=1` too.
   Then check the units on the server: `systemd-analyze verify /etc/systemd/system/leadhound-*` and `systemctl list-timers 'leadhound-*'`.

## Everyday

- `make deploy HOST=… [ARCH=…] CONFIRM=1` ships a new release: it runs `make check`, builds a static Linux binary, copies it with `deploy/install.sh`, the backup script and the units, runs `migrate` with the new binary as the owner role, then puts the new binary and units in place, reloads systemd and enables the timers.
  A failed `migrate` stops the deploy with a non-zero exit and leaves the old binary and units running; the release stays in its temporary directory on the server.
- `make deploy-data HOST=… CONFIRM=1` copies `leadhound.yaml` and `ats-boards.yaml` from `LEADHOUND_PRIVATE_DIR` (default `../job-hunt/leadhound`) after checking the profile loads; run it after you edit either file.
  It copies nothing else: the title screen is part of `leadhound.yaml`, and the eval golden set, the privacy denylist and the board seed lists are never needed on the server.
- `make remote HOST=… ARGS='track list'` runs one command on the server as the `leadhound` user with the units' environment.
  `track list`, `rules list` and `boards list` run freely; every other command writes or reaches the network (`collect`, `canary`, `brief`, `score`, `migrate`, `recheck`, `probe`, `track <n> …`, `rules add`, `boards import` …) and needs `CONFIRM=1`.
  `ARGS` is split into words by your own shell, as on a command line, and each word reaches `leadhound` whole: the server's shell never reinterprets it.
- `remote` runs without the units' hardening, memory ceiling and timeouts.
  It does take the units' locks, without waiting: `collect linkedin`, `canary` and `brief` take the LinkedIn lock and `score` the score lock, and when a timer's run holds one, `remote` exits 75 and runs nothing; try again when it has finished (`systemctl list-units 'leadhound-*'`).
  Even so, prefer to run collects and briefs by hand only while no timer is due.
- `deploy`, `deploy-data` and `remote` run their `sudo` steps over `ssh -t`, so `sudo` can ask for its password at your terminal.
  Run without a terminal (from a script), ssh warns that it allocates none, and the steps then need `sudo` without a password for the ssh user.
- `deploy` and `deploy-data` refuse to run, even as `make -n`, without `HOST` and `CONFIRM=1`; `remote` refuses without `HOST`, and without `CONFIRM=1` for anything but the read-only lists.
- The brief's LinkedIn recheck runs before the day's `brief_log` row is written, so a brief that crashes in between rechecks again on its retry; the three-try limit bounds that.

## Restore

Dumps are in `pg_dump`'s custom format:

```sh
sudo -u postgres pg_restore --clean --if-exists -d leadhound /var/backups/leadhound/leadhound-<stamp>.dump
```
